# Balloon-shooting-je
This is a simple balloon shooting game I did as part of my application for a part-time teaching position at Junior Engineers. The premise of the game is quite simple, the player tries to shoot down a randomly moving balloon. The game ends when the player manages to hit the balloon, and the game will display the number of missed shots. The .sb is the game's SmallBasic source code, and requires a SmallBasic compiler.

The game is created using SmallBasic. A programming language developed by Microsoft to teach children about basic programming concept.
